<p>	As the days have gone by, I'm starting to enjoy the MCO (Movement Control Order).
I realize, this is the precious chance for me to spend time with my family.
I love to hearing the sounds of roosters crow in the morning as opposed to the roar of the traffic.
I'm learning to appreciate every little thing that I took for granted before.</p>

<p>	I miss my friends and my daily routine at campus.I miss going to classes and hangout with my friends.
I've spent my days at home by playing many mobile games such as Clash of Clans and Mobile Legends: Bang Bang.
I also have the opportunity to learn cooking.I learn how to make "kuih kicap".
It is one of the famous "cucur" at my hometown (Belaga, Sarawak).
The taste is a little bit spicy because I put "sambal" on it.You must try it by yourself. It's delicious.
"Kuih Kicap" is one of the best foods that I grew up eating.</p>

<p>	Sometimes, I also spent time with my siblings playing cards and monopoly.
I hate losing to my sisters.They will provoke me when I lose. That reminds us about our childhoods.
I you ever wonder where are my parents at, they are at my village.This MCO separated us.
Of course I do miss my parents so much.Every week the will contact us because at my village dont have network connection.
They will contact us from our farm at the village.Luckily, the farm is the only place that have network connection at my village.</p>

<p>	To keep myself healthy, I regularly do some exercise at home such as push up, jumping jack, sit up and playing footballs.
I feel very good and very fresh after done those exercises.It also do helps me to release my stress.
Stay at home does not means that we just sit and lay on our bed.We must keep our body and mind healthy.</p>

<p>	I really enjoy all the things that I do during this MCO (Movement Control Order).
I'm learning to appreciate people arounds me and yes I always contact my friends.
Spending more times with my family is the precious moments and chance for me.
I hope that I will learning more during this MCO period.Stay safe, you are loved.</p>
